            After graduating with a BA in art history, I realized that I might not want to have a career in that field. I started teaching, but after two years I realized that I didn't want a career in teaching either. I also knew that I didn't want to go back to school for multiple years and get a degree. I have many friends who have careers in technology, and seeing how much they loved going to work everyday, I started researching coding and watching tutorials. After a couple months of learning on my own I decided to enroll in a program.

            Preferably, I would like to work at a company that is small/medium sized, and tech-oriented. I want a job where I can work on both team projects as well as individual projects. I want to be learning new things everyday while also strengthening my existing skills. Being surrounded by fun, creative, and energetic people is also a plus.

            I first started watching coding videos on my own and learned the basics of both html and css. After decided it was something I wanted to learn more about and possibly have a career in, I enrolled in Career Foundry's online web development program.
